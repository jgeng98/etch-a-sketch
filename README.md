# Etch-a-Sketch

Interactive webpage where a user can "draw" on an Etch-a-Sketch by clicking and dragging. User can choose from three tools (regular drawing, eraser, and a rainbow mode where the colour is randomly chosen from a pre-determined selection) and the size of the grid (small, medium, large). Other functionality includes a button that toggles the gridlines of the Etch-a-Sketch and a clear button.

Project from the [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) Foundations path and modified slightly by me.

Note: it is currently not mobile friendly - that may (and probably should) change in the future but I can't be bothered right now.
